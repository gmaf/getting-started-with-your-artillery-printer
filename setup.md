# Setting up your new Artillery 3D printer

You might be very tempted to quickly unpack and assemble your new printer and start printing. **DON'T JUST YET !**

**Before and during unpacking make sure to take some pictures of the box and of it's contents**. Make sure you have good light and cover most of the angles. In case something might have happend during packing or shipping this will be your proof that it wasn't your fault so it's good that you have the unpacking process documented. Artillery has been very flexible and has never asked for this kind of proof but you never know.

## Assembling your 3D printer

In case of the **Sidewinder** and his little brother the **Genius** this is pretty straight forward. You just need to insert the part holding in Z and X axis into the base of the printer, fix it with the 4 screws and then plug the 4 cables for the Z motors, Z endstop and filament sensor.

One thing to be careful with is the plug at the base of the left Z gantry that looks like an [ISA connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture). If that part is not inserted properly it can create a lot of problems in the future as all the connections for the X motor and the extruder block pass though it. If unsure, you can always loosen the 2 screws holding the connector and pushing it more towards the base of the printer.

### Screws and connections

You have to check that at least all the visible screws on the base of the printer and on the Z and X gauntries are properly tightend and that none are missing. A missing screw could be hiding between other printer components and jam the mechanisms or create a short circuit.

Check that all the ribbon cables are properly inserted. Remove the plastic cover of the extruder block (makes it easier) unplug the ribbon cable and then re-insert it. The other end of this cable did not seem to create issues for anyone so far, but it's worth at least visually inspecting the connector. Do the same (unplug and plug back in) for the ribbon that goes up and down the left Z gantry.

You can safely leave the filament sensor unplugged. It's creating more issues than it solving, so unless you're running a print farm or doing very long prints you're better of without it. Do not remove it as it's good for guiding the filament and making sure your filament does not unravel from the spool, just unplug it.

### Belts and wheels

Belts need to be properly tight. You should be able to pinch them almost like a guitar string. Each end of the belt has an idler that is fixed to a piece of metal that in turn is fixed to the gantry with two screws. To tighten the belt, unscrew the two screws, pull the idler assembly and re-tighten the screws. It's a good practice to re-check the belts tension from time to time to make sure they did not get loose.

The wheels that walk the gantries are equiped with eccentric nuts. Because the gantry profile and the wheels are angled this is called a **v-slot** roller system. This allows one of the wheels to move closer or farther from the gantry so that the part that needs to move does not have any play and can freely slide. For the X and Z axis there are 3 wheels hoding each part, with the 2 on one side being fixed and the 3rd on the other side being movable via the eccentric nut (so the one on the bottom for the extruder block and the inner ones for the Z axis holding the X gantry). The Y axis holding the bed on the other hand has four wheels, two on each side and only the ones on the right side have eccentric nuts which you should try to tighten so that both apply the same pressure.

**The wheels need to be tight enough so that the part is not wobbly and only moving in the direction it's supposed to. You should be able to move them by hand and the movement should feel smooth from one end to the other.**

> First time you do this, you might feel two bumps about 1/3rd of the ends of each axis (for the X and Y as for Z you can't really check this). It is normal and it will even out after a few days of printing. This is because the wheels have been tightened and left in the same position for a long time and the rubber has deformed a bit.

In time, the wheels will gather some dust part from your environment and part from the factory coating. Wipe them with a cloth or a cotton tip from time to time.
