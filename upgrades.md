# Upgrades for your Artillery printer

Now that you got your printer up and running and spitting out [calicats](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1545913) like there's no tomorrow, you might be inclined to do a **firmware upgrade** to get the latest and greatest. Unfortunately Artillery only provides one firmware based on [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/) 1.1.9 which is the latest version of [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/) 1.x released in August 2018. There is a good reason for that which we will discuss a bit later, but for now **don't do any changes to the firmware**.

You should run your printer for a couple of weeks to make sure it runs fine in the default configuration. Play with the [slicer](slicer) settings, experiment with different materials, see what works and what doesn't and try to understand why.

## A better nozzle

One thing that might give you a bit of a headache in the begining could be the nozzle that came installed in the printer. Leaving asside the fact that it's a low quality nozzle and it will wear out over time, mine was already partially clogged from the factory. I spent about 4 days trying to tune my slicer settings and the presure of the extruder idler lever until I decided to replace it with the spare provided with the printer. After that everything magicaly worked like it should have from the begining.

So do yourself a favor and order some [good quality nozzles](3d-printer-overview#the-nozzle) to have handy. But don't go for the steel nozzles just yet as their main purpose is printing abrasive materials which you will not be doing any time soon.
