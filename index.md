# Getting started with your Artillery 3D printer

This guide is aimed at new people looking to get into 3D printing and is a collection of articles and videos that helped me getting starting. It is mostly aimed at setting up your new Artillery 3D printer, be it the Genius or Sidewinder X1 but the same principles apply to most cartesian 3D printers. Inspiration came from the repeating questions in the [Artillery Genius facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/artillerygenius/), people seem to have the same issues and ask the same questions mostly due to the fact that they don't understand the process of 3D printing in general, have not read the basics, or did not check/calibrate their printers. 

Fist things first.  

> **A 3D printer is nothing like regular printer.  
You can't just plug it in and click 'print'**. 

If you buy a 3D printer and expect it to '*just work*' prepare to be disappointed. Unless you spend at least 800 EUR on a [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3-kit.html) (and not even that will guarantee a perfect print each time) your under $300 Chinese 3D printer won't perform like in the reviews you read or watched. The reviewers have a lot of experience, understand how everything works and know how to tune those devices to perform best. Quality control of products coming from China is getting better but it's far form perfect so issues like a loose screw, unplugged cable, broken components etc. are still common things. If you don't take time to understand how it all works, finding the culprit for your issue can take a lot of time and frustration. So be prepared to spend a few days learning a bit about the mechanics, electronics and software development involved in 3D printing. 

Be patient and go through the following topics in order:
- [How 3D printing works](understanding-3d-printing)
- [Overview of a 3D printer](3d-printer-overview)
- [Role of the slicing software](slicer)
- Printing materials
- First things to do after unpacking your printer (calibration, bed leveling and first things to print) and what not to do
- Artillery printers in depth (components, firmware upgrade)
- Pimp up your artillery
- Common issues and fixes

So, now that we got that out of the way, let's get started !
