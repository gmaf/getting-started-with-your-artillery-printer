# Getting started with your Artillery 3D printer

This guide is aimed at new people looking to get into 3D printing and is a collection of articles and videos that helped me getting starting. It is mostly aimed at setting up your new Artillery 3D printer, be it the Genius or Sidewinder X1 but the same principles apply to most cartesian 3D printers. Inspiration came from the repeating questions in the [Artillery Genius facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/artillerygenius/), people seem to have the same issues and ask the same questions mostly due to the fact that they don't understand the process of 3D printing in general, have not read the basics, or did not check/calibrate their printers.

So, let's get started !
