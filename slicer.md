# Slicer PC sofware

The slicer is a software that transforms a 3D model into 3D printer instructions known as G-code. Once again, this is no easy feat as the G-code has to describe every single move your printer has to perform, this includes moving the print head on X, Y and sometimes Z while also extruding or retracting filament and/or accelerating to some desired speed, increasing part cooling fan flow, changing bed and extruder temperature etc. All of this happens in the G-code exported by the slicer.
