# Slicer PC sofware

Now that we have a basic understanding of [how a 3D printer works](3d-printer-overview) and what [materials](materials) can be used, let's understand the brains that controls the 3d printing process. 

**The slicer** is a software that transforms a 3D model into 3D printer instructions known as G-code. Once again, this is no easy feat as the G-code has to describe every single move your printer has to perform, this includes moving the print head on X, Y and sometimes Z while also extruding or retracting filament and/or accelerating to some desired speed, increasing part cooling fan flow, changing bed and extruder temperature etc. All of this happens in the G-code exported by the slicer.
