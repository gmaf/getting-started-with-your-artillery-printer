# Upgrade to a MKS SGEN L 32bit board

This page will describe how you can upgrade your Artillery Genius (works for the Sidewinder also with small firmware changes) to a MKS SGEN L 32bit board and TMC2209 stepper motor drivers.

> **Work in progress**

## Installation and connections

Should be a drop-in replacement, with little changes to the connections (BLTouch plugs and extruder LED lights).

## Mainboard Firmware

[Repository for the firmware](https://github.com/kind3r/genius-firmware-mks-sgen-l)
