# The 3D printer

At it's core level, a 3D printer is basicaly a molten plastic spiting contraption (extruder block or tool) that can move in 3D space to create your model. For a better comparison, think of a motorized hot glue gun. 

> TODO: 3d printer schema (screen, mainboard, drivers, motors, extruder)

In order to be able to achive the 3D spatial movement, the [cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_robot) printer has 3 axis (X, Y and Z) independently controlled by 3 or more stepper motors which ensure precise movement of the extruder block so that the molten plastic is dropped where it needs to be. X and Y axis are both on the horizontal plane leaving the Z axis for vertical movement. 

> A great article explaining all the movements of the axis can be found here: [3D Printer Axis: The Basics](https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printer-axis-all-you-need-to-know/). 

> For more details about the stepper motors watch this video: [How does a Stepper Motor work ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyqwLiowZiU). 

Now that you have an ideea about the movement of the motors, let's investigate the role of the motor driver. The driver handles routing the power to the 2 stepper motor coil pairs while providing an easy control interface. The printer's CPU tells the driver to move a specified number of steps in some direction with a specified speed and the driver translates this into alternating current for the 2 coil pairs in order to perform the specified move. Drivers can perform silent moves by using babystepping technology, they can also detect if a motor moved or not thus providing virtual endstops. 

A stepper motor (and driver) has no way of knowing it's current position, let alone the position of the axis it's moving. What it can do, is mark it's current position as an initial refference and record future positions relative to that initial refference. So in order to have the actual position relative to the print surface, printers use endstops as a reference position of one axis (normaly the 0 coordinate). That is what **homing** is for. The printer moves the specified axis motor slowly in the direction of the endstop until that endstop triggers and then records that position as being 0 for that axis. All further moves will now have a reference point so the CPU can address coordinates directly.

## X and Y axis

X and Y axis work in similar ways, they are both usually controlled by a single stepper motor each and a belt that moves the extruder block left and right for the X axis and the bed (back and front) for Y axis. 

Common issues with X and Y axis derive from the tightness of the belts. If the belts for those axis are too lose, when the motor is turning the belt might not so the desired movement is not transmited to the extruder block or the bed, resulting in shifting layers. On the other hand, if the belt is too tight it will put too much pressure on the axle of the motor and the motor itself won't be able to move, also resluting in shifting layers. 

Other issues can come from the fact that the moving parts (the bed and the extruder block) are not properly fixed to their frame on which they slide. On some printers metal rods with linear ball bearings are used. But in case of Artillery aluminium v-rails are used to suport the heavier direct drive extruder (more about later). On this type of system, wheels on one side of the rail have excentric spacers that allows moving the wheel closer or farther from the rail thus making sure the moving part only slides on the desired axis. If the wheels are too close to the rail, the motor will have difficulty pulling the bed or the extruder block and will create wear on the belts and the wheels. If the wheels are too far, then the moving part will have a play and this will lead to inconsistent layers.

## Z axis

Z axis is a bit different. The motor is connected to a threaded rod via a coupler. This works like a nut on a screw: you turn the screw and the nut goes up or down. Of course, the screw (rod) being so long, issues can apear if it's not perfectly straight. This is why the coupler has a flexible part designed to compensate for the rod not being perfectly straight. The Genius on the other hand uses a different mechanism in the form of a **Z nut coupler** mounted on the X caridge that alows some play to compensate for a not so straight rod. Is this better than a flexible coupler ? Time will tell.

## Extruder block

The extruder block (or generic tool) is responsible for droping molten plastic on the print surface. It's centerpiece is the **hotend**, this is where most of the magic happens. The basic principle is that a **heating element** heats the **heatblock** which in turn heats the **nozzle** while the **thermistor** monitors the temperature. The role of the **heatbreak** is to stop the heat coming from the **heatblock** to transfer to the other parts of the extruder block. The filament is pushed through the heatbreak and reaches the nozzle where it melts and is then extruded on the print surface. In order to further help disipate the heat coming from the heatblock, the heatbreak is also conected to a **radiator cooled by a fan**.

> For more details about the hotend parts (**nozzle, heatblock, heating element, thermistor** and **heatbreak**) watch [Hotend explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzRAVkXjw3I).

![Heatbreaks](img/heatbreak.jpg)

There are 2 types of heatbreaks:
- PTFE lined
- All metal

Both types have advantages and disadvantages.

PTFE lined | All metal
---------- | ---------
Better thermal insulation between the heatbreak and filament | Prone to clogs
At 250C PTFE tube degrades and releases toxic fumes | Works for temperatures above 250C, good for nylon or PC
PTFE tube will degrade over time as it's in contact with the nozzle and will need to be replaced | Less maintenance
Better retraction | Slightly worse retraction

As you can see from the comparison, all metal heatbreaks allow you to print higher temp speciality materials like nylon but printing common ones can be troublesome as the lack of thermal insulation provided by the PTFE tube could melt PLA inside the heatbrake and cause it to clog.

Recent advancements let to the creation of the bi-metal heatbreak, basically a variation of the all metal one with an extra layer designed to provide better insulation between the heatbreak and the filament flowing through it.

![Nozzle sizes](img/nozzle.jpg)

There are two commonly used nozzle sizes: Volcano and V6. They were both developed by E3D.

> Throughout the brief history of the 3D Printing Industry, E3D has become synonymous with quality and reliability, leading the market with our modular V6 high performance HotEnd. <https://e3d-online.com/nozzles-for-3d-printer>

It should be prety obvious that the Volcano style, having a longer melt zone, offers an advantage over the V6 being able to print faster as filament has more time to melt. But, since the filament spends more time in the melt zone, this can act like a double edged sword. Filament will ooze from the nozzle more often, this in turn can increase stringing if retraction is not properly setup and it can even burn out inside the nozzle leading to partial clogs. This is why it's important to use a good quality filament, but more on that later.

![Nozzle materials](img/nozzle-materials.png)

Of course, nozzles can be made from different materials having different properties, depending on your printing needs. 

Most common material is **brass**, this has the advantage of a very good thermal transfer between the heat block and the nozzle but being a soft material it wears over time. The wear can lead to partial clogs, imprecise printing and plastic sticking to it leaving blobs on your print. But, being very cheap it's affordable to replace in case this happens. 

**Hardened steel** nozzles offer wear resistance at the price of lower thermal transfer. They are a bit more expensive than **brass** ones and allow you to print tougher materials like carbon fiber, wood and metal infused filaments without having to worry about possible wear. 

Other nozzle materials include **stainless steel**, **plated copper** and my favourite nickel plated hadrened steel Nozzle X.

Nozzle build quality is very important for a succesfull print, **save yourself the trouble and get a good quality set of nozzles**. If you find E3D's pricing a bit too much, you can look for other know good brands on Aliexpress such as [Mellow](https://mellow.aliexpress.com/store/1531088?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.f9144c4dxYeTik) or [Trianglelab](https://trianglelab.aliexpress.com/store/1654223?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.f9144c4dxYeTik). Cheap nozzles often have imperfections due to the manufacturing process, either deviations from the dimensions or even leftover materials that eventualy lead to clogs or worse.


Another component of the extruder block is the **part cooling fan**. This helps cooling the extruded material so that it does not melt over the previous layer. While cooling is required by some materials like PLA, other materials require very little or no cooling at all (ABS, ASA etc.). A good fan shroud can help guide the airflow where it's actually needed and not spread the air it all over the place.

In case of Artillery and other **direct drive** printers, the extruder block also contains the filament feeder motor and gear. Other printers have this feeder placed somewhere else and connect it via a PTFE tube to the heatbreak. This is called a **bowden** extruder. In short, direct drive alows for more materials to be printed (like flexibles) and performs a better extrusion and faster retraction leading to less stringing. On the other hand it adds weight to the extruder block increasing inertia of it's movement and possibly adding vibrations leading to inconsistency of the layers.

> A good comparison between both systems can be found in the [Direct vs Bowden Extruder: Does It Make a Difference?](https://all3dp.com/2/direct-vs-bowden-extruder-technology-shootout/) article.

The extruder block may also contain a bed leveling probe like the well known BLTouch. This probe acts similar to an endstop for the Z axis, except it can be placed almost anywhere on the bed as opposed to the regular endstop which has a fixed position. By probing multiple points on the bed, the printer's software can create a virtual image of the bed's surface and adjust all print moves acordingly.
